# GPU Kernel Programming with Triton

This repository contains a series of custom implementations and explorations of GPU kernel-level programming using [Triton](https://triton-lang.org/), focused on performance optimization and low-level memory access.

Each module builds upon the last, culminating in applied techniques for linear algebra, attention mechanisms, and cross-entropy loss computation ‚Äî all optimized for GPU architectures (tested on RTX 40-series cards).

## üåü Key Highlights

- üöÄ **Memory-Efficient GPU Code**: Explicit memory movement and vectorized operations
- üìä **Real-World Performance Benchmarking**: Tested on RTX A6000 and 40-series cards
- üîç **Detailed Inline Commentary**: Step-by-step explanation of memory scope, threading, and compute
- üß† **Mathematics + Systems Blend**: CUDA-level control without CUDA complexity
